    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cherry Varenyky are a hallmark of Ukrainian cuisine. Lush, tasty and aromatic, they are well liked by everybody. Today we'll show you an unusual recipe for making them. Specifically, we'll cook them using ice-cold water. Intrigued? Then let's start.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold water, 100 ml.</li>
        <li>Salt, 1/4 tsp.</li>
        <li>Cherry, 700 g.</li>
        <li>Starch, 1 tbsp.</li>
        <li>Egg, 1 pc.</li>
        <li>Wheat flour, 250 g.</li>
        <li>Sugar, 100 g.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack one egg into a bowl. Add a quarter of a teaspoon of salt to it and mix everything with a fork.</li>
        <li>Pour 100 ml of very cold, almost ice-cold water into the bowl with the egg.</li>
        <li>Add well-sifted flour to the bowl, and knead a stiff dough.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough until it stops sticking to the table and hands. Do not add too much flour as to not clog the dough. Wrap the dough into a cling film and leave it on the table for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Wash the cherries and remove the pits. Add a few tablespoons of sugar into a bowl with cherries. Mix everything well. Leave the berries and sugar for a few hours so that they release juice.</li>
        <li>After two hours, put the cherries in a sieve and let all the excess liquid drain.</li>
        <li>After the juice done draining, move cherries to a plate and sprinkle with starch. Thoroughly mix the berries with starch.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into a thing layer and use a cutter or a glass to cut out round shapes for our varenyky.</li>
        <li>Put a spoonful of berries into the center of each shape, add a pinch of sugar and tighly pinch the edges of the varenyky.</li>
        <li>Cook them for 7-8 minutes in boiling, slightly salted water.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the finished varenyky with sugar. They are best served with sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
