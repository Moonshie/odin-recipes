    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our Ukrainian borscht is amazing, without a doubt: aromatic, bright in color, delicious. And the best addition to it will, of course, be fluffy golden pampushky with garlin and green dressing.</p>
    <p>Since we'll be making them from yeast dough, we need to prepare some ingridients so that things turn out exactly how we want them. Take the butter out of refrigiretor a little in advance, as you'll need it softened.</p>
    <p>The milk needs to be warmed up a little before you pour it into the dough. It's important no to heat it too much, it should never boil. For the yeast to work, it just needs to be a little warm.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wheat Flour, 450 g.</li>
        <li>Warm milk, 250 ml.</li>
        <li>Butter, 100 g.</li>
        <li>Dry yeast, 10 g.</li>
        <li>Sugar, 1 tbsp.</li>
        <li>Salt, 1/2 tsp.</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves, 3 pcs.</li>
        <li>Dill, 6 pcs.</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, 2 tsbp.</li>
        <li>Vinegar, 1 tbsp.</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper for dressing, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, first mix the dry ingridients for the dough: 450 g of wheat flour, 10 g of dry yeast, 1 tbsp of sugar, and 1/2 tsp of salt. Add sugar to a different side of the bowl from yeast. Then, add 250 ml of warm milk, then 100 g of softened butter.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough, it shouldn't stick to your hands. Leave it in a warm place for 45 minutes, covered with a towel or cling film. Then wrap the dough and divide it into 12 balls, forming buns. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius.</li>
        <li>Carefully spread the buns into a mold that should be greased with butter or oil. Leave the buns in the form for another 30 minutes. We used a rectangular shape about 28 by 16 cm, but you can use a round one or any other, it doesn't really matter here.</li>
        <li>After the buns have come up, place them into oven to bake for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, make the dressing. Peel 3 cloves of garlic and chop very finely. Place them into a small bowl. Wash and dry the greens of 6 sprigs of dill, then finely chop them too. Combine with garlic. Add 2 tablespoons of sunflower oil, 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and salt and pepper to your liking. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Generously por the dressing over our finished pampushky, while they are still hot, so they are better saturated with the aromas.</li>
    </ol>
