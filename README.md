# odin-recipes
This is the first project I'll do for TOP - a simple recipe website. <br>
With this I plan to test how well I've learned basic HTML and writing commit messages. <br>
I have decided to use traditional Ukrainian meals for the theme. <br>

<strong>Update</strong>:
Now that it's done, I'm quite happy with the result and will like to revisit it with some knowledge of CSS later.
